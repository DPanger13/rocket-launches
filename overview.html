Android app that shows movie information.
<p>
    This Android app is made up of two parts: the application layer and the data layer. The application layer holds all
    framework-related implementations, such as Activities and Services, and all middle layer components, such as View
    Models and Controllers. The data layer is a separate Android project that is used to get the data needed for the
    app. Documentation for the data layer is provided in that project.
</p>
<p>
    The application layer is further divided into modules based on the feature they correspond to. There is a single
    module, base, that all modules inherit. It contains resources common to more than one feature. Each additional
    module is a self-contained feature, which can be one or more screens.
